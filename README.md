# FastDMM

Welcome! This is a map editor for BYOND designed to not suck as much, mostly by not wasting 3 minutes of your time for an object tree to generate.

### Features

- The ability to specify filters more specific than just "obj, mob, area, turf"
- The ability to place directional objects more easily
- It doesn't fail miserably when trying to render 64x64 icons and/or planes.

### Great, now how do I use it?

- First, use `Open DME` option to open an environment file. Then use open, and select the desired map from the list.
- Use middle mouse button to move your view and scroll wheel to zoom in/out
- If you select an object and hold down control and click on a tile, and while holding your mouse button down, you move your mouse in a direction, you can specify a direction for the var.
